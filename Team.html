    Gender roles refer to the expectations society places on individuals based on their perceived gender.
    Traditionally, men have been associated with leadership, labor, and protection, while women have been expected
    to focus on caregiving and domestic responsibilities. However, these roles are not universal and vary across cultures
    and historical periods. Over time, societal shifts have challenged rigid gender norms, promoting greater flexibility
    and equality.
