    In my house, we don’t divide tasks based on gender. My mom and I try to share the chores equally. We both clean, cook, and take care of everything together. It has always been this way, and we believe it’s fair to work as a team. However, if I am honest, my mom usually does a little more than me. She always helps me when I am busy or tired, and I am very thankful for her. We are not perfect, but we try to support each other and make our home a happy and organized place.

    Gender roles refer to the expectations society places on individuals based on their perceived gender.
    Traditionally, men have been associated with leadership, labor, and protection, while women have been expected
    to focus on caregiving and domestic responsibilities. However, these roles are not universal and vary across cultures
    and historical periods. Over time, societal shifts have challenged rigid gender norms, promoting greater flexibility
    and equality.  Gender roles are social constructs, like when you grow up you need a bid family and have kids an a husband, and be de maid of both, vice versa with the man, he needs to be the 
    provider for his family.

   In my home, we don’t split things like if we need to do that especifically thing, we just vibe and do it together, since I was a child I didn’t know what was a gender role with my mom but with my dad i always see those things and I hate that since then
