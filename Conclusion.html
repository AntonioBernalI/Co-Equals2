    <p>Across all the interviews, we observe a significant evolution in gender roles over the years.</p>

    <article class="interviewee">
        <h3>Grandmother</h3>
        <p>She recalls a time when women were expected to stay at home while men were the sole providers. While she acknowledges the security this structure provided, she also recognizes the lack of freedom it imposed on women.</p>

    <article class="interviewee">
        <h3>Father</h3>
        <p>He reflects on a past where men were required to be strong providers and women managed the household. Although he appreciates the progress toward gender equality, he admits that some outdated expectations still persist in certain areas of society.</p>

    <article class="interviewee">
        <h3>Sister</h3>
        <p>She highlights the pressure women once faced to marry young and now values the increasing career opportunities for women, as well as the growing involvement of men in parenting. She believes that true equality comes when both genders share responsibilities without societal judgment.</p>
    </article>

    <article class="interviewee">
        <h3>Uncle</h3>
        <p>He notes the once rigid gender expectations but believes that greater flexibility and acceptance benefit society. He supports the idea that men and women should be able to choose their roles freely without conforming to traditional norms.</p>
    </article>

    <article class="interviewee">
        <h3>Personal Perspective</h3>
        <p>From a broader standpoint, gender roles have undeniably evolved for the better. While traditional roles provided structure, they often limited individual potential. The move toward gender equality allows people to define their own paths without being confined by historical expectations. However, challenges remain, and societal attitudes continue to adapt. The key lies in fostering an environment where everyone, regardless of gender, can thrive based on their skills and aspirations rather than outdated norms.</p>
    </article>

    <p><strong>Overall, all interviewees agree</strong> that gender roles have evolved positively, leading to increased freedom and equality for everyone. While there is still progress to be made, the shift towards inclusivity benefits individuals and society as a whole.</p>
