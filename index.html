  <i>Co-Equals</i> is a group of four teenagers who aim to explore and share what gender roles look like in their homes.
  Through personal experiences and reflections, they seek to highlight how these roles influence daily life,
  responsibilities, and family relationships. Their goal is to encourage discussions about gender equality,
  challenge stereotypes, and promote a better understanding of these dynamics in everyday life.

    Gender roles refer to the expectations society places on individuals based on their perceived gender.
    Traditionally, men have been associated with leadership, labor, and protection, while women have been expected
    to focus on caregiving and domestic responsibilities. However, these roles are not universal and vary across cultures
    and historical periods. Over time, societal shifts have challenged rigid gender norms, promoting greater flexibility
    and equality.
