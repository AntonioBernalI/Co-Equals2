<h2 class="spec">In this Section we're going to present the interviews, that we had with our family members, to know
their opinion and stories about them
</h2>
<br>
<h1>Daniela</h1>
<h2 class="spec2">Dani: Grandma, how were gender roles when you were a child?</h2>
<br>

<h2 class="spec2">Grandmother: Well, in my time, women were expected to stay at home, take care of the children, and do house tasks. Men, on the other hand, were the breadwinners. It was very uncommon to see women working outside the home.</h2>
<br>

<h2 class="spec2">Dani: How do you think gender roles have changed since then?</h2>
<br>

<h2 class="spec2">Grandmother: Oh, they have changed a lot! Women now have careers, and many men share housework and childcare.</h2>
<br>

<h2 class="spec2">Dani: Do you think these changes are positive?</h2>
<br>

<h2 class="spec2">Grandmother: Yes! Women have more independence, and men are more involved in family life. It’s better for everyone.</h2>
<br>
<h1>Nicole (valeria)</h1>
<h2 class="spec2">Vale: Dad, what were gender roles like when you were a kid?</h2>
<br>
<h2 class="spec2">Father: When I was growing up, men were expected to be strong, provide for the family, and not show emotions. Women were mostly in charge of raising the kids and managing the household.</h2>
<br>
<h2 class="spec2">Vale: Have you seen any major changes in gender roles?</h2>
<br>
<h2 class="spec2">Father: Definitely. Now, men are encouraged to be more emotionally open, and women can have successful careers. There’s more balance between work and home responsibilities.</h2>
<br>
<h2 class="spec2">Vale: How do you feel about these changes?</h2>
<br>
<h2 class="spec2">Father: I think they’re great. It’s important for both men and women to have choices and share responsibilities equally.</h2>
<br>
<h2 class="spec2">Toño: How do you think gender roles were different when our parents were young?</h2>
<br>
<h1>Antonio</h1>
<h2 class="spec2">Sister: Back then, there was a lot of pressure for women to marry young and prioritize family over careers. Men were supposed to be the providers, and there wasn’t much flexibility.</h2>
<br>

<h2 class="spec2">Toño: Do you think things are different now?</h2>
<br>

<h2 class="spec2">Sister: Yes, for sure! Women are breaking barriers in all kinds of professions, and men are becoming more active in parenting. There’s still work to do, but we’re heading in the right direction.</h2>
<br>

<h2 class="spec2">Toño: What do you hope for the future regarding gender roles?</h2>
<br>

<h2 class="spec2">Sister: I hope we move past stereotypes completely and let people define their roles based on what makes them happy, not based on gender expectations.</h2>
<br>
<h1>Andres</h1>
<h2 class="spec2">Andrés: Uncle, can you tell me about gender roles when you were younger?</h2>
<br>

<h2 class="spec2">Uncle: Sure! When I was young</h2>
<br>

<h2 class="spec2">Andrés: Do you think things have changed a lot since then?</h2>
<br>

<h2 class="spec2">Uncle: Oh yes. Today, there’s more acceptance of different roles. Women can be leaders, men can be stay-at-home dads, and people are encouraged to follow their passions regardless of gender.</h2>
<br>

<h2 class="spec2">Andrés: Do you think this shift is beneficial?</h2>
<br>

<h2 class="spec2">Uncle: I do. It gives everyone more freedom to be themselves and contribute to society in a way that suits them best. It’s a positive change.</h2>
